Your task is to translate the untranslated fields:
	•	Source language: en
	•	Target languages: [de, es, fr, it, ja, ko, ru, zh-Hans, zh-Hant, zh-HK]

🎯 Your goal is to:
	1.	Preserve the existing JSON structure, including all keys and comments.
	2.	For each key, insert corresponding \"stringUnit.value\" fields for the target languages under \"localizations\".
	3.	For each key, insert \"stringUnit.state\" fields with \"translated\" for the target languages under \"localizations\".
	4.	Keep placeholders like %@, %d, {username} unchanged in all translations.
	5.	If a localization for a given language already exists, overwrite the \"value\" field with your new translation.

Example input:
\"Start\": { },

Example output:

- n. 争论，争执，纷争
