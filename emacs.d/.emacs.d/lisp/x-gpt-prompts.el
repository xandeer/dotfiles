Make sure to include the programming language name at the start of the org mode code blocks.
This is an example of python code block in emacs org syntax:

- [dis'pju:t]
- v. 争端，纠纷
- n. 争论，争执，纷争

1. dis: 这个前缀通常表示否定或相反的含义。在 /dispute/ 中，它为冲突或分歧设定了背景。
1. pute: 这一部分可能让你想起「争论」的意思。它是单词的核心，可以让你联想到争吵或解决分歧的概念。

因此，当你想到 /dispute/ 这个单词时，你可以将它与负面的分歧或冲突联系起来，涉及争论或解决分歧的过程。

- Synonyms: conflict, argument, controversy
- Antonyms: agreement, accord, consensus

*** Countries are encouraged to settle their {{c1::disputes}} peacefully.
